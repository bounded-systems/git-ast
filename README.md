# Git AST: A Language-Aware Git Extension

Git AST provides **language-aware extensions for Git**, leveraging Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) instead of traditional line-based diffs. This enhances Git with semantic understanding, leading to more meaningful history, easier merges, and enhanced code consistency.

## Value Proposition

Why use Git AST?

- **Cleaner Diffs:** Focus on meaningful code changes, ignore formatting noise
- **Smarter Merges:** Reduce conflicts caused by code movement or non-competing structural edits
- **Consistent Formatting:** Enforce a canonical code style automatically across your repository

## How It Works

Git AST leverages Git's clean and smudge filters to operate on the structure of your code:

1. **When You Commit:** Source code is parsed into a syntax tree (AST/CST) and stored in Git
2. **When You Check Out:** The stored tree is converted back into consistently formatted source code

This structural approach lets you focus on semantic changes rather than textual differences.

## Project Status

**Design stage — not yet a working tool.** This repository is primarily a design
worked out in [`docs/`](./docs/README.md), plus a small Rust skeleton that
compiles and exposes the subcommand surface (`git-ast filter-process |
diff-driver | merge-driver`). The filter, diff, and merge logic are
**placeholders**: parsing, serialization, and pretty-printing are not implemented
yet. The hardest open problem — stable AST node identity across versions, which
structural diff/merge and refactor-aware history depend on — is described in
[`docs/planning/scope.md`](./docs/planning/scope.md) and explicitly out of scope
for the initial MVP.

If you are evaluating this repo: the value here is the architecture and the
problem framing, not a runnable extension.
